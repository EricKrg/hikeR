# hikeR
A shiny application in order to ease up planning for the next hiking or bike trip.

# ~~server version currently not working~~ Working again, enjoy! http://mccoy.geogr.uni-jena.de:3838/eric/hikeR/

## *graph hopper* routing is not working at the moment, because i dont have a working api key
## to deploy the application, download repo and start it locally - for graphhopper and cyclestreets.net routing a api key is required
